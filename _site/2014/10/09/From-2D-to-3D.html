		<p>Since my last post, I have been working on adding .gitignore files, writing READMEs, and adding licenses to all of my projects. Now that I am done with this somewhat tedious work, I feel that it time to start a new project. So far this school year, I have been working with a 2D graphics system called canvas, and it has worked great for 2D physics; however, I think it would be cool if I could expand my simulators to the third dimension. To do this, I started learning a javascript library called <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, which allows you to create 3D graphics, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to be very hard to use. Geometric shapes have predefined classes, and you can add textures to objects simply by using a mesh function. Once an object is created, you only need to add it to the scene for it to become visible. You also define a camera, which is the viewing prospective of the 3D world. Moving objects is simply done by preforming transformations on an <span class="caps">XYZ</span> coordinate system. As for the physics, vecotrs in othagonal directions can be delt with independently, meaning that I will only need to make minimal changes to my algorithms for my 3D projects. Overall, I am looking forward to using three.js, and I hope to write a simple tutorial for it once I finish learning it myself.</p>
