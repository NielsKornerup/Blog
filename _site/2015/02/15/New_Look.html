		<p>I made <a href="http://nielskornerup.github.io/">my homepage</a> in around 40 minutes during an afternoon, and honestly, it looked terrible. I am by no means a graphic designer, and you could tell by looking at it. When I send out my resume to someone, I link to my homepage, as it contains all of my computer science projects from this year. I realized that this would be their first impression of me, and thus I should try harder to make it look good. Again, I am not a graphic designer, so I can’t just come up with a good homepage out of thin air. For inspiration, I started looking at <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, an open source tool that “makes front-end web development faster and easier.” It turns out that bootstrap has templates that can be used to make a professional looking website without needing to worry too much about graphic design. I implemented their homepage template, which is what my homepage now looks like. The only problem with this was that I used to store an introduction to all of my projects on this page, which is no longer possible with this minimalist design. To fix this, I added a projects tab to the front page, and using another template I found with bootstrap, I created another page to display my projects. So far, I am happy with the results, and at some point in the future, I will do the same thing with this blog. Since doing this, I have gotten my response from Kevin, and am now learning <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">Mongodb</a> as well as <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. As a result, redesigning my blog will be put on a back-burner for now, but I am looking forward to getting around to it eventually.</p>
