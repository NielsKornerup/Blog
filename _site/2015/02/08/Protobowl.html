		<p><a href="http://protobowl.com/">Protobowl</a> is a website that allows quizbowl players to face each other online. It is a great study tool, and is used by many good players. Having come to a good break point with my natural selection simulator, I decided it was time for a new project. I emailed one of the members of the protobowl team, <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15">Kevin Kwok</a>, asking if he wanted any help. I was expecting not to get a reply, or to be declined, as this is a well established group. Surprisingly, I received a yes. It turns out that Kevin started protobowl during his Junior year in high school. He was very friendly, and told me about a couple projects that he planed on adding. I found interest in making an aster chart to display playerâ€™s score by subject, and accuracy within each subject. Keven wanted me to do this using the <a href="https://github.com/antimatter15">Javascript D3 library</a>, which is very powerful, but has a steep learning curve. After some investigation, I managed to find someone else who had made an aster chart using the library, Ben Best. I used his <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/bbest/2de0e25d4840c68f2db1">aster chart</a> as the backbone for <a href="https://github.com/NielsKornerup/qbPieChart">mine</a>. After building it, I asked Ben Best for permission to use his as the basis for mine, and he accepted. After finishing up the code, the project is now on Github, and I am waiting for a response from Kevin about how we want to implement it. I want to say thank you for Kevin for allowing me onto the team, and thank you to Ben Best for letting me use his code. I am looking forward to my work being implemented, so that I can say that I am part of the protobowl team.</p>
