		<p>Hello, World! This is my first post from my new blog. This blog is run using jekyll. If you were not following my blogspot account, I am a student at <span class="caps">LASA</span> High School and I am currently taking independent study computer science. In the future, I will be making posts about my progress on various projects, all of which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/NielsKornerup">github page</a> .</p>
