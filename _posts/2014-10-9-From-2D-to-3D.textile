title: Three.js
excerpt: Now that I have finished my 2D physics simulation projects, I am working on expanding them to 3D.

Since my last post, I have been working on adding .gitignore files, writing READMEs, and adding licenses to all of my projects. Now that I am done with this somewhat tedious work, I feel that it time to start a new project. So far this school year, I have been working with a 2D graphics system called canvas, and it has worked great for 2D physics; however, I think it would be cool if I could expand my simulators to the third dimension. To do this, I started learning a javascript library called "three.js":http://threejs.org/, which allows you to create 3D graphics, and it doesn't seem to be very hard to use. Geometric shapes have predefined classes, and you can add textures to objects simply by using a mesh function. Once an object is created, you only need to add it to the scene for it to become visible. You also define a camera, which is the viewing prospective of the 3D world. Moving objects is simply done by preforming transformations on an XYZ coordinate system. As for the physics, vecotrs in othagonal directions can be delt with independently, meaning that I will only need to make minimal changes to my algorithms for my 3D projects. Overall, I am looking forward to using three.js, and I hope to write a simple tutorial for it once I finish learning it myself.
