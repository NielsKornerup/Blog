Github has a program where high school students can get deals that help them become web developers. I just recently got added to their system, and have been messing around with what has become available to me. For starters, [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) has given me $100 in credit, which I plan to use to set up and manage the LASA Quiz Bowl database. I also get access to Visual Studio for free, which is a great platform for writing C++ code. Github also gives me free private repositories, as well as their micro account for free. Despite all of these things, one of the more interesting opportunities that became available was that [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) gave me a free .me address for a full year. This week in independent study, I have been setting up my new URL, [nielskornerup.me](nielskornerup.me). To set up my address, I followed David Ensinger's [guide](http://davidensinger.com/2013/03/setting-the-dns-for-github-pages-on-namecheap/) for setting up a namecheap domain on Github, and before long, I had a respectable URL. After completing this, I decided that I wanted to set up the other perk of having your own URL; the ability to get a custom domain name. I found another guide for how to do this online, and now I can be accessed at the email nielskornerup@nielskornerup.me. I have been busy catching up from the school that I missed last week, and thus have not had much time to work on my projects. My protobowl project [Protocharts](http://protobowl.herokuapp.com/) is currently up and running, but Kevin still needs to look into errors entering data. I think I will be working on setting up the LASA Quiz Bowl database, but I don't know how interested I really am in the project. I have been wanting to work more with algorithms/logic and less with deciphering libraries for a while now, and I have also been wanting to learn a new language such as python or Haskell.
