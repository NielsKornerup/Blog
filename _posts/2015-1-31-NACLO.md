title: NACLO
excerpt: I take the North American Computational Olympiad test for the first time.

As the questions have not been released yet, I cannot talk about the questions in this competition, so instead I will be giving an overview of my experience. I first heard about NACLO during my freshman year, but have been unable to take the test until this year. The idea is to discover information about languages using logic, and then apply this knowledge to solve problems. The competition requires extracting information from the questions that you are trying to answer, for example if you know that three words start with a specific sound in a matching question, you can look at the answers and find three words that begin with a letter. You now know that that letter makes that sound. It feels like a huge accomplishment whenever you succeed in collecting information out of nothing. Also, this skill can be used on poorly designed tests. In order to graduate, I need to take PE classes, which I am currently doing via Aikido. The state of Texas makes me take tests on personal fitness, but the tests are poorly designed, so I can sometimes use the same type of logic I use in NACLO to answer questions. The puzzles are also brain teasers, and are quite enjoyable. I am not sure whether or not I will advance to the next round, but it was definitely a rememberable experience, and I will defiantly do it again next year!
